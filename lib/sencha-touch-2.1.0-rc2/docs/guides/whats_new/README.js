The foremost focus of the release is performance -- getting apps running fast on as many devices as possible. Apps start up much faster, provide a much snappier initial render and layout, and lay out again immediately when a device is roatated. Among the other significant enhancements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A brand new scroller, optimized for each platform and faster than ever - especially on Android devices. We've optimized the rendering process and have applied innovative techniques to reuse existing components without having to instantiate new ones.</p></li>\n<li><p>Many innovations from Ext JS 4, including the advanced new class system, reconfigurable components, and improvements to application architecture.</p></li>\n<li><p>Increased support for a wider range of devices with reduced emphasis on WebKit and a more robust platform that we can use to support more devices over time.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Here's a closer look at these and other enhancements introduced with Sencha Touch 2.0.</p>\n\n<h2 id='whats_new-section-2'>Smaller, faster layout engine</h2>\n\n<p>Sencha Touch offers a very flexible layout system that makes it easy to lay out apps for a variety of device shapes and sizes. Version 2 brings a layout engine that runs much more like the browser's optimized CSS engine. The result is enormously improved performance in several key areas:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apps render and lay out faster on startup</li>\n<li>Updating the screen after rotating the device is much faster than with Sencha Touch 1.x apps</li>\n<li>Layout engine is much smaller, resulting in faster download</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>All of the layout configuration options from Sencha Touch 1 continue to work with the new layout engine so you don't have to change a line of code.</p>\n\n<p>The result is massively improved layout performance across the board. Screens pop onto the page much faster when navigating through the app, giving a much more fluid experience. The most dramatic improvement occurs when a device changes orientation. The new layout engine is so fast we had to use a high-speed camera to measure it. Here’s the Kitchen Sink buttons example running on 1.x and 2.x, slowed down to one quarter speed:</p>\n\n<p><a style=\"text-align: center\" href=\"http://vimeo.com/30296006\"><img src=\"http://img1.sencha.com/files/misc/20111010-video-full.jpg\" /></a></p>\n\n<h2 id='whats_new-section-3'>Stronger, smarter core</h2>\n\n<p>Sencha Touch benefits from a shared development environment with Ext JS. Ext JS 4 brought a range of new innovations that are now build into Sencha Touch, including the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Upgraded class system with support for dynamic loading and dependencies</li>\n<li>Support for class configurations as a core construct - gives you getters and setters for free and a clean, consistent API</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3>Faster startup time</h3>\n\n<p>We weren’t happy with app startup time in 1.x so we’re optimizing everything we can with startup. So far we’re seeing between 10% to 25% improvement in startup time on a range of devices when testing our Kitchen Sink example. This app is sizable—it demonstrates almost every component in the framework. On many devices, it loads almost a second faster in 2.x:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://img1.sencha.com/files/misc/20111010-sencha-touch-startup-times.png\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id='whats_new-section-4'>Class system and apps</h2>\n\n<p>Sencha Touch 2 uses the powerful new class system from Ext JS 4. This provides all the benefits of dynamic loading, intelligent builds that only include the classes you use, mixins, configurations, and all the other features of the new engine. For details, see the <a href=\"http://docs.sencha.com/touch/2-0/#!/guide/class_system\">How to use classes in Sencha Touch 2</a> guide.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve also brought across the Ext JS 4 application architecture, that includes ComponentQuery and production build support. We’re not quite done with the model view controller (MVC) packaged in the developer beta release and will be adding features like deep linking/history support in upcoming previews and betas.</p>\n\n<h3>Config-driven components</h3>\n\n<p>One of the benefits of the new class system is the ability to set up 'configs' - simple properties that are automatically given getter and setter functions, defaults, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Sencha Touch 2 makes use of the config system throughout the framework. Whenever you see a config on a class you already know that you can reconfigure it at any time (even after it is rendered). Even better, because the config's setter name always follows the same pattern you already know what function to call.</p>\n\n<p>For example, we can give a <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.field.Text\" rel=\"Ext.field.Text\" class=\"docClass\">Text Field</a> a label when we instantiate it and then know we can easily change it later:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var text = <a href=\"#!/api/Ext-method-create\" rel=\"Ext-method-create\" class=\"docClass\">Ext.create</a>('<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.field.Text\" rel=\"Ext.field.Text\" class=\"docClass\">Ext.form.Text</a>', {\n    label: 'My Field'\n});\n\n//anything we can configure also has a setter function\n//its name always follows the setConfigName pattern\ntext.setLabel('Another Field');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Configs are great because they give classes a very clean API. Everything you see under the 'Config options' in the API docs for each class is a true config complete with standardized getter and setter functions.</p>\n\n<p>For a full overview of the new capabilities see the <a href=\"#!/guide/class_system\">Class System guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id='whats_new-section-5'>Improved MVC Capabilities</h2>\n\n<p>Sencha Touch 1 came with a simple way to organize your application along MVC (Model View Controller) lines. Sencha Touch 2 significantly improves on this, incorporating full history support, a powerful new way to control Components, and a powerful way to customize your application for a different screen sizes.</p>\n\n<p>On top of this, the data package has been ported to use the new class system, making it much more flexible and improving performance. For a full overview on the MVC improvements in Sencha Touch 2 see the following guides:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#!/guide/apps_intro\">Intro to Applications</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#!/guide/profiles\">Profiles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#!/guide/controllers\">Controllers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#!/guide/history_support\">History Support</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2 id='whats_new-section-6'>Much better Android support</h2>\n\n<p>Sencha Touch 2 brings a big improvement in Android performance, particularly when it comes to scrolling and animation. In Sencha Touch 1.x Android devices were noticeably slower when scrolling through large lists. Animations could be choppy and exhibit weird visual artifacts.</p>\n\n<p>Touch 2 gives Android its own optimized mechanism for achieving both smooth scrolling and fast, fluid animations. We’ll go further into the technology behind these advances at SenchaCon later this month, but for now here’s the Motorola Atrix again, showing just how much faster 2.x feels on Android devices:</p>\n\n<p><a style=\"text-align: center\" href=\"http://vimeo.com/30324079\"><img src=\"http://img1.sencha.com/files/misc/20111010-video-sm.jpg\" /></a></p>\n\n<h2 id='whats_new-section-7'>Native packaging</h2>\n\n<p>One of the most common questions developers ask when building Sencha Touch apps is, “How do I get my app in front of customers?” In many scenarios, building and deploying apps to the web is exactly what developers want and customers expect. In other cases, getting apps in to app stores is the fastest way to reach customers.</p>\n\n<p>Sencha Touch 2 makes it incredibly easy to build and deploy apps to both the Android Marketplace and the iOS App Store. Today, along with Sencha Touch 2 preview, we’re shipping a developer preview of our SDK Tools 2.0. The new SDK Tools include a new <code>sencha package</code> command that enables you to take your Sencha Touch app and package it up as an APP for iOS or an APK for Android. It’s that easy: One command, and your app is ready to be submitted to Apple or Google for distribution.</p>\n\n<p>To make a developer’s life easier, on iOS the packager doesn’t require the native SDK so you can package without having to download Apple’s SDK. Just download the SDK Tools and you’re ready to build. If you’re deploying to Android, you’ll need to download the Android SDK from Google. For developers who do have the the native SDKs, you can use the SDK Tools to directly push your app to the iOS and Android emulators so you can see how your app will run on device.</p>\n\n<p>The SDK Tools Developer Preview is now available on Mac OS X; Windows and Linux support will be added soon. We’ll also be adding device APIs that will make it easy to use native features like camera and contacts among others. For all the details on how to use the new packaging capabilities, see <a href=\"#!/guide/native_packaging\">Native Packaging for iOS on Mac</a> and <a href=\"#!/guide/native_android\">Native Android Packaging</a>. We think you’ll be as excited as we are with how easy it is now to build and package your web app for native distribution.</p>\n\n<h2 id='whats_new-section-8'>Overhauled docs</h2>\n\n<p>All of the most widely used classes in Sencha Touch 2 feature excellent documentation right in the API reference. Interspersed into the class docs are dozens of live examples that run right in your browser and let you see (and even modify) the example code on the fly. We’ve also brought all of the SASS variables for each component into the API docs, making it much easier to see what you can customize.</p>\n\n<p>We’re shipping 11 <a href=\"#!/guide\">brand new guides</a> out of the box. We have guides that explain core concepts like layouts, components, and classes, others that cover how to use components like tab panels, forms, and carousels, and  a new getting started guide that takes you through building your first app from scratch.</p>\n"});
