        <content type="text/html"><![CDATA[Dear Kort-User<br /><br />The last few month we worked hard to make kort an even better experience. Today we proudly release the brand new features and hope you like them as much as we do.
            Kort Reloaded comes with an overall improved map that let's you solve missions and validations at the same time, just to name one of the new improvements.
            But the most important new feature still operates in the shadows until it is activated on the 12th of june, just in time when the <a href="http://www.fossgis.de/konferenz/2013/" target="_BLANK">FOSSGISS 2013</a> conference opens it's door at the HSR in Rapperswil.<br /><br />

            We are still very interested in your opinions. Please keep telling us what you think about kort.<br /><br />

            Stay tuned for more news that are expected to be delivered soon.<br /><br />

            Best regards<br />
            The Kort Development Team
